Contains the main Discord bot implementation written in C using the Concord Discord library. This is the core component that handles Discord interactions, processes educational commands, and communicates with the dashboard.

- **Language**: C
- **Key Features**: Discord API integration, educational interaction handling, WebSocket communication with dashboard
- **Main Files**: `main.c`, `tccbot.h`, various source modules

### üåê [`dashboard/`](./dashboard/)

Web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing the educational bot. Built with Node.js and Express, providing real-time insights into bot activities and educational interactions.

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Key Features**: Real-time monitoring, WebSocket communication, web interface
- **Framework**: Express.js with WebSocket support

### üìä [`slides-latex/`](./slides-latex/)

LaTeX source files for presentation slides related to the thesis project. Contains the academic presentation materials with UFPR branding.

- **Format**: LaTeX/Beamer
